            This year, we deepened our presence
            in each of these segments, onboarding
            new OEM partners and growing
            existing relationships enabling wider
            coverage across OEM service
            networks and the aftermarket
          </p>

            Today, we work with over 40 leading
            OEMs, with partnerships built on
            a shared commitment to quality,
            performance and innovation. These
            alliances go beyond product supply
            and involve co-developing highperformance lubricants tailored
            to evolving engine technologies,
            mobility solutions and operational
            conditions. We are also fostering these
            partnerships across segments while
            expanding our role in mobility with
            OEMs.

            footprint across categories reflects not
            just our product credibility, but also
            our ability to evolve with the shifting
            contours across sectors.
