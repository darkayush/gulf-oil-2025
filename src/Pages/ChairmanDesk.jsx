            <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
              It is with immense gratitude that I address you to reflect on the remarkable journey of Gulf Oil Lubricants India Limited in the fiscal year 2024-25. This year has been a defining period, marked by achieving many new milestones with record-breaking performance and significant strategic moves that position us strongly for the future. Reflecting its confidence in the company’s financial strength and commitment to rewarding shareholders, the Board declared a total dividend of ₹48 per equity share, comprising an interim dividend of ₹20 and a final dividend of ₹28 representing a payout ratio of 65%, the highest in our history. Our achievements reflect the passion of our team, the clarity of our vision and the support of our valued stakeholders.

              ...uncertainties. India remains a standout in the global market, demonstrating impressive growth of 6.5%. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the challenging domestic environment marked by general and five state elections, which temporarily impacted project rollouts.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              The automotive industry demonstrated resilience and registered overall domestic sales growth of over 7%. This was led by a strong recovery in the two-wheeler segment, which grew by over 9% and the highest-ever sales in passenger vehicles, which saw a 2% rise. However, the commercial vehicle segment faced a slight decline with delayed construction.

              Industry and infrastructure activities, Indian automotive industry continues to grow fuelled by rising vehicle ownership and technological advancements. Concurrently, the adoption of electric vehicles remained gradual signalling the early stages of broader market acceptance.

            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the Indian lubricants industry recorded a steady volume growth of 3–4%. The market is gradually shifting toward premiumization, driven by increasing demand for synthetic and bio-based products, which are enhancing the overall value proposition. India’s growing middle class, rising disposable income and ongoing urbanisation are driving increased demand for high-quality lubricants, particularly in semi-urban and rural areas.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              In this dynamic context, we significantly outpaced the industry, achieving 2–3x industry growth rate, highlighting its competitive edge, brand strength and industry expertise. However, in certain segments, we even recorded nearly 5x the industry growth rate.

            <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
              Our “Unlock 2.0” strategy has been instrumental in driving our outperformance backed by passionate and committed team at all levels. We have focused on specific pillars to deliver exceptional results. Under the Accelerate pillar, we drove targeted growth in our core business. We achieved significant acceleration in key areas, including strengthening our presence in rural markets, expanding our export footprint and deepening partnerships with major OEM clients. These focused efforts have amplified our brand’s reach and resonance. Our premium synthetic and semi-synthetic lubricants grew at more than double the rate of our overall business. Under the Transform pillar, we are building a future-ready, digital-focused organisation. Over the past few years, we have doubled our IT and digital investments and fully implemented platforms like Salesforce to boost efficiency and customer engagement. These efforts are reshaping how we operate and deliver value. We are strategically advancing, making significant progress across the complete range of EV charging portfolio. Our subsidiary, Tirex, in which we hold a 51% stake, delivered over 300% top-line growth during the year. These efforts are strengthening our EV segment in line with our vision.

              Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts, guided by our founder’s philosophy, continue to create meaningful, long-term community impact. Through our “Road to School” and “Road to Livelihood” initiatives, we have supported over 15,000 students with academic resources, digital literacy and career guidance. Under our “Kushal Mechanic Training” programme we empowered over 1,800 mechanics with necessary training and skill development and have benefited over 4,000 families by installing water ATMs providing clean water access to the community.

            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              Sustainability is integral to our business ethos. This year, we significantly strengthened our ESG framework by embedding a robust governance system from the Board level to our daily operations. A dedicated team now drives our sustainability agenda, focusing on key areas of water conservation, renewable energy, waste management and energy efficiency.
