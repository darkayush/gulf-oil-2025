            <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
              It is with great pride that I reflect on the performance of Gulf Oil Lubricants India Limited in FY 2024-25. As we navigate the evolving landscape of lubricants in a highly competitive market along with the emerging e-Mobility segment, we are strongly positioned to lead growth, driven by our commitment and passion for enhancing sustainable value creation.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              FY 2024-25 was a landmark year for Gulf Oil, with performance reaching record levels quarter by quarter. Revenue rose to ₹3,554 Crores, an 8.2% increase over the previous year, driven by volume growth at more than 2x the industry average, winning with all-round segment focus. EBITDA grew by 12.1% to ₹470 Crores, with margins improving to 13.23%, reflecting strong cost discipline and operational efficiency despite headwinds like rupee depreciation and raw material price volatility. Profit after tax grew by 17.6% to ₹362 Crores, supported by robust cash generation of ₹423 Crores from operations, up 21.6% from the previous year. This led to a record cash balance of ₹1,027 Crores, providing financial flexibility for future investments.

              ...portfolio, and solid partnerships with marquee B2B customers and over 40 OEMs. We achieved strong growth across rural, industrial, IMF, and OEM FWS segments, driven by rising demand in high-growth sectors like manufacturing and mining. With a strong strategy and a broad presence across B2C, B2B, infrastructure, mining, fleet, and ports, we’ve consistently delivered all-round growth—much like a cricket all-rounder, outpacing industry averages in multiples. We continue to strengthen our market share and create meaningful differentiation in the dynamic lubricants industry.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              India’s infrastructure investments, projected at ₹143 trillion by FY2030, are opening major opportunities for our specialised lubricants and services. Our customised, value-added solutions continue to meet the evolving needs of marquee customers, reinforcing our position as a trusted partner in B2B.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              In B2C, we saw strong performance, especially in personal mobility, with double-digit volume growth driven by customer-focused campaigns, an improved product mix, and wider network reach. The motorcycle oil segment, with brand Gulf Pride, was a standout performer, while growing demand in the car segment adds further momentum. Our extensive distribution network of 90,000+ touchpoints enabled strong urban and rural market presence, reflecting strong brand visibility and consumer access.

            <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
              We remain one of India’s leading and most trusted suppliers of AdBlue®, with volumes rising to 1,40,000 KL in FY 2024–25, from 1,28,000 KL the previous year driven by the increasing adoption of BS-VI compliant vehicles and our vast distribution set-up. Further, we entered into exclusive partnerships with Amara Energy, giving us access to over 6,500 retail outlets. The recent merger of AdBlue® with encryption-based anti-counterfeiting features highlights our commitment to quality and helped retain our market share. Looking ahead, we expect annual volume growth of 10–15%, supported by continued focus on marquee OEMs and quality conscious buyers. In the battery segment, we are leveraging the equity of Gulf Oil in the two-wheeler replacement market. With 518 active Gulf Battery Service Points and 220 distributors, we remain focused on enhancing service quality and driving growth.

            <h4 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Transforming with e-Mobility</h4>
            <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
              Through our strategic investments, we are building a strong presence across the EV value chain—spanning products and services—and positioning it as a key future growth driver. Our DC fast charger subsidiary, Tirex Transmission (51% stake), recorded 300% revenue growth, reaching ₹69 Crores, and has deployed over 3,000 chargers across India, reflecting strong market traction. Our EV investments also include strategic stakes in Indra Renewable Technologies, a manufacturer of AC home chargers poised to enter the Indian market with local production potential, and Techperspect Software (brand Electreeef), which offers advanced charger management solutions. These initiatives are supported by engagement with marquee customers, exploring export footprint and deepening partnerships with major OEM clients. These focused efforts have amplified our brand’s reach and resonance. Our premium synthetic and semi-synthetic lubricants grew at more than double the rate of our overall business. Under the Transform pillar, we are building a future-ready, digital-focused organisation. Over the past few years, we have doubled our IT and digital investments and fully implemented platforms like Salesforce to boost efficiency and customer engagement. These efforts are reshaping how we operate and deliver value. We are strategically advancing, making significant progress across the complete range of EV charging portfolio. Our subsidiary, Tirex, in which we hold a 51% stake, delivered over 300% top-line growth during the year. These efforts are strengthening our EV segment in line with our vision.

            <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
              This year marked a significant shift in our branding strategy, led by two major consumer-focused campaigns with 360-degree approach—'The Unstoppables' and 'The Gulf Pride Relaunch'. The 'Unstoppables' was our biggest-ever brand campaign, featuring MS Dhoni, Hardik Pandya, and Smriti Mandhana. It successfully integrated traditional and digital media to drive deeper consumer engagement and awareness.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              The Gulf Pride relaunch marks the company’s biggest campaign so far for two-wheeler engine oil, showcasing refreshed packaging and a latest upgraded API SP grade formulation with a 10,000 km drain interval and enhanced engine protection, making it one of the company’s most advanced product offerings to date. Featuring MS Dhoni in a unique romantic avatar, it delivered the message, "Bike se pyaar hamesha rehtha hai" (love for bike always stays).
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              These high-impact campaigns, along with our continued association with IPL team Chennai Super Kings, significantly improved brand metrics, visibility and recognition, positioning us among the top 3 lubricant brands in India.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              We also strengthened our community connect through India Bike Week, powered by Gulf XP, that which brought together 25,000 riders, reflecting Gulf’s strong connect with premium bike enthusiasts. Digitally, we saw strong engagement, social media traction and e-commerce integration, reinforcing Gulf’s identity as a dynamic and consumer-centric brand.

              As we enter the data centre liquid cooling industry, we have developed two promising products: a high-end synthetic (PAG-based) fluid and a mineral-based fluid. These are currently undergoing proof-of-concept trials, with support from our Global Technical team and R&D centre in Chennai. We are also exploring strategic opportunities that leverage our brand and network to ensure growth in both core and emerging businesses.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              We aim to sustain volume growth at 2–3 times the industry average by focusing on product innovation, brand strengthening, premiumisation, all-round segment growth and by achieving our digital and e-mobility transformation. We are establishing a-mobility as a meaningful pillar of our future growth. In parallel, we are building a strong team across the organization to execute our strategic vision effectively.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4'>
              To support our growth ambitions, we plan to expand our lubricants production capacity by ~10%—from 140 million litres to 240 million litres, across both plants over the next two years. The Board has taken capacity expansion a key strategic move, vital to our long-term growth goals. With the continued support of our shareholders and the commitment of our people and partners, we are well-positioned to drive sustainable growth and long-term value.
